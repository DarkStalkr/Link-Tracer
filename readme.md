# LinkTracer

LinkTracer is a Google Chrome browser extension that allows users to analyze web links quickly and securely. This extension provides several key features that enhance the browsing experience and help users make informed decisions when clicking on external links.

## Key Features



### Proxy Configuration
The extension allows users to configure a proxy server for anonymous and secure browsing. They can specify the type of proxy, the host, and the desired port.

### Link Analysis
When users right-click on a link on a web page, LinkTracer analyzes the link's URL for relevant information. This includes the IP address of the linked server, the types of outbound requests it makes, and other important data.

### Security
LinkTracer automatically disables any potentially dangerous scripts or content on the destination page of the link. This helps protect users from online threats.

### WHOIS Lookup
The extension performs a WHOIS lookup on the IP address of the linked server to provide information about the owner or organization behind the linked website.

### Abuse Index
LinkTracer checks databases of link abuse indexes to determine if the website linked to has been previously reported for malicious or deceptive activities.

### Configuration Confirmation
When users save the proxy configuration, they receive immediate confirmation in the form of an alert message indicating that the configuration has been successfully saved.
